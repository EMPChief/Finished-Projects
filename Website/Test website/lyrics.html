            [Verse 1]<br>
            I might be the villain in somebody else's story, but that's fine
            My methods are controversial, but at least it keeps them all in line
            In line<br><br><br>

            [Pre-Chorus]<br>
            I don't need your roses, I like men on their knees<br>
            Praying up to their god, seeing visions of me<br><br><br>

            [Chorus]<br>
            I'm a cult leader, mind reader, heart eater<br>
            Fear feeder, say I'm your favorite preacher<br>
            If I wasn't a narcissist, I wouldn't like me either<br>
            I'm a cult leader, best believe that she's a keeper<br>
            Grim reaper looking for my cheerleaders<br>
            If it's between love and money, I'd rather have neither<br><br><br>

            [Verse 2]<br>
            So charming, it's alarming<br>
            I'm hurting everybody that I know<br>
            Lead the masses from the ashes<br>
            I want power and I think it shows<br><br><br>

            [Pre-Chorus]<br>
            I don't need your roses, I like men on their knees<br>
            Praying up to their god, seeing visions of me<br><br><br>

            [Chorus]<br>
            I'm a cult leader, mind reader, heart eater<br>
            Fear feeder, say I'm your favorite preacher<br>
            If I wasn't a narcissist, I wouldn't like me either<br>
            I'm a cult leader, best believe that she's a keeper<br>
            Grim reaper looking for my cheerleaders<br>
            If it's between love and money, I'd rather have neither<br><br><br>

            [Outro]<br>
            I wanna be a leader, leader, leader, no<br>
            Leader, leader, leader, no<br>
            Leader, leader, leader, no<br>
            Leader, leader, leader, no<br>
            Leader, keeper, best believe her<br>
            You ain't ever seen her do it quite like me<br><br><br>
