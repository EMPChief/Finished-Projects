Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a mischievous monkey named Max. Max was known for his love of pranks and his misadventures in the jungle.

One sunny day, Max decided to play a prank on his best friend, Leo the lion. Max sneaked into Leo's den and painted colorful stripes all over Leo's majestic mane while he was taking a nap.

When Leo woke up and saw his reflection in the river, he let out a mighty roar that echoed through the jungle. All the animals gathered around, laughing at Leo's new look.

Max couldn't contain his laughter and burst out from behind a tree, rolling on the ground with amusement. Leo, initially furious, couldn't help but join in the laughter too.

From that day on, Max and Leo became the best of friends, always finding new ways to bring joy and laughter to the jungle.

And the animals in the jungle never missed an opportunity to remind Leo of his colorful makeover.

One day, Max and Leo were playing in the jungle when they came across a group of animals who were arguing. The animals were arguing about who was the best animal in the jungle.

Max and Leo decided to have some fun, so they started to make fun of the animals. They called them names and made fun of their looks. The animals were very angry, and they started to chase Max and Leo.

Max and Leo ran as fast as they could, but the animals were faster. Just when it seemed like the animals were going to catch them, Max had an idea.

Max stopped running and turned to the animals. "Wait!" he said. "I have a riddle for you."

The animals stopped chasing Max and Leo and listened to the riddle. "What has a head and a tail, but no body?" Max asked.

The animals thought for a moment. "A coin!" one of the animals said.

"That's right!" Max said. "And what do you do with a coin?"

The animals thought for a moment. "You flip it!" one of the animals said.

"That's right!" Max said. "And what happens when you flip a coin?"

The animals thought for a moment. "It lands on heads or tails!" one of the animals said.

"That's right!" Max said. "And what do you call it when a coin lands on heads?"

The animals thought for a moment. "A win!" one of the animals said.

"That's right!" Max said. "And what do you call it when a coin lands on tails?"

The animals thought for a moment. "A loss!" one of the animals said.

"That's right!" Max said. "So, what do you think happens when you flip a coin to decide who is the best animal in the jungle?"

The animals thought for a moment. "The best animal in the jungle is the one who wins the most flips!" one of the animals said.

"That's right!" Max said. "And who is the best animal in the jungle?"

The animals looked at each other and smiled. "We are!" they said.

Max and Leo laughed. "You're right!" they said. "We are the best animals in the jungle!"

And so, Max and Leo lived happily ever after, always finding new ways to bring joy and laughter to the jungle.

And the animals in the jungle never missed an opportunity to remind Leo of his colorful makeover.

The end.

But that's not all! There's more to the story!
